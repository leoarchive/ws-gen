HTML started in 1991 and here are some tags you may not have known about:

# HTML 1: \<ISINDEX\> (Deprecated)
![](https://www.uv.es/jordi/v3/html/html/tags2a15.gif "https://www.uv.es/jordi/v3/html/html/tags2a15.gif")

> The \<isindex\> tag is used to display search strings in the current document. The tag is placed inside the \<head\> element.
> 
> The \<isindex\> is a deprecated HTML tag and not supported correctly by browsers. To define a single line input field, you need > to use the \<input\> tag with the \<label\> tag, which executes the same function as the prompt attribute.

# HTML 2: \<TT\> (Deprecated)

> The \<TT\> HTML element creates inline text which is presented using the user agent's default monospace font face. This element > was created for the purpose of rendering text as it would be displayed on a fixed-width display such as a teletype, text-only > screen, or line printer.

# HTML 2: \<SAMP\>

# HTML 2: \<STRIKE\> (Deprecated)

![](https://thedeveloperblog.com/tutorial/htmlpages/images/htmlstriketag.png "https://thedeveloperblog.com/tutorial/htmlpages/images/htmlstriketag.png")

> The \<kbd\> HTML element represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any > other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a \<kbd\> element using its default > monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.

# HTML 3.2: \<BIG\> (Deprecated)

![](https://thedeveloperblog.com/tutorial/htmlpages/images/html-big-tag.png "https://thedeveloperblog.com/tutorial/htmlpages/images/html-big-tag.png")

> The \<big\> HTML deprecated element renders the enclosed text at a font size one level larger than the surrounding text (medium > becomes large, for example). The size is capped at the browser's maximum permitted font size.

# HTML 3.2: \<CENTER\> (Deprecated)

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210208121539/cent.png "https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210208121539/cent.png")

> The \<center\> HTML element is a block-level element that displays its block-level or inline contents centered horizontally > within its containing element. The container is usually, but isn't required to be, \<body\>.
> 
> -- <cite>https://developer.mozilla.org/</cite>

# HTML 4.0.1: \<APPLET\> (Deprecated)

> The \<applet\> tag was used to define an embedded Java applet. The use of Java applets is now deprecated as most browsers no > longer support the use of plug-ins, including the Java plug-in.
> 
> The \<applet\> element can contain other HTML tags and text between its opening and closing tags.
> 
> Some browsers still support the \<applet\> tag, but they require additional plug-in or installations to work.

# HTML 4.0.1: \<BDO\> 

![](https://w3cschoool.com/public/file/HTML/html-bdo-tag.png "https://w3cschoool.com/public/file/HTML/html-bdo-tag.png")

# HTML 5: \<BDI\> 

![](https://static.javatpoint.com/htmlpages/images/html-bdi-tag.png "https://static.javatpoint.com/htmlpages/images/html-bdi-tag.png")

> The \<bdi\> HTML element tells the browser's bidirectional algorithm to treat the text it contains in isolation from its > surrounding text. It's particularly useful when a website dynamically inserts some text and doesn't know the directionality of > the text being inserted.
